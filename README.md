# Website development

In this repository you will find two projects from my "Tehnologii Web" coursework. These projects were made during the second semester of my first year in University and they are designed for:
- Tema_2: the frontend for the Barcelona FC football team which includes HTML + CSS code
- Weather_App: which incorporates frontend and backend: HTML + CSS + Javascript(used for interacting with json files)
